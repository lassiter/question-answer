# What is question-answer (qa) trying to accomplish?
This is primarily an integration project to convert audio from video and potentially image captures from video from youtube into a readable json format to use with Agolia search that will deploy with a React template and documentation to modify. The end goal is to create an easily deployable series microservices for educational youtube channels that have someplace to host the final front-end.

# What is the status of this project?
This is currently a stubbed git repository. I'm hoping to start by creating a contributing file, then work on the (Roadmap)[https://github.com/lassiter/question-answer/projects/1]. I'm thinking about runnning everything on a javascript stack, if I can delegate the language processing through a third party that has a free teir, likely a Google service since this will be processing YouTube content.
